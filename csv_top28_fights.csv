The Best Anime Fight Scenes of All Time,,
1. Goku vs. Vegeta (First Fight),'Dragon Ball Z',"Before ""Super Saiyan"" transformations came into play in their second encounter during the ""Buu Saga,"" Goku and Vegeta brutalized each other in their base forms when they first clashed. I got so wrapped up in all the drama produced by their back-and-forth brawl - both of these pureblood Saiyans only got stronger and angrier the more they took damage from each other's stiff strikes and energy attacks. Watching Goku tap into his ""Kaioken"" technique to even the odds and witnessing Vegeta transform into a giant Great Ape to terrorize Goku & his buddies only added to the epic feel of this classic ""Saiyan Saga"" encounter. - Elton Jones"
2. Goku vs. Frieza (First Fight),'Dragon Ball Z',"What follows next is one of the longest yet highly engrossing fights in DBZ history. There are nasty punches, sick kicks, tail whips, pimp slaps, and even biting going down in this one. I cheered so damn hard when Goku used a final energy blast to wipe out Frieza and escape an exploding Planet Namek just in the nick of time. - Elton Jones"
3. Gohan vs. Cell,'Dragon Ball Z',"From there, I was locked in on every emotional development and brutal blow Gohan and Cell had inflicted on each other. This fight is full of so many wild moments - Cell's sudden bearhug on Gohan, Gohan unlocking his true potential at the sight of Android 16's head getting smashed to bits, Gohan tearing the Cell Jr.'s apart with ease, and that iconic Father-Son Kamehameha that finished off Cell are all breathtaking moments derived from this encounter. - Elton Jones"
4. All Might vs. All For One,'My Hero Academia',"I couldn't help feeling like the rest of the heroes, students, and quirk-less onlookers who cheered on All Might as he used a decisive ""United States of Smash"" to punch All for One into oblivion. That final image of a weakened and bloody All Might holding up a fist of victory defines this superpowered brawl as one of the best anime fight scenes I've ever seen. - Elton Jones"
5. Endeavor and Hawks vs. High-End Nomu,'My Hero Academia',"Endeavor ends up losing an eye during this drag-out melee but still finds the will and power within him to keep on going. What's so effective about this fight is how even though Shoto Todoroki still hasn't forgiven his father Endeavor for what he's done to him and his siblings, he can't help but feel thankful that he ultimately prevails. - Elton Jones"
6. Tanjiro and Nezuko vs. Rui,'Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba',"Tanjiro certainly had his hands full with Rui and his extra sharp webs. Even when things got dire once Tanjiro's blade got broken, his sister Nezuko arrived on the scene to defend her brother with a rabid assault of her own. I'm not gonna lie - when Nezuko got caught up in Rui's web, I started losing all hope...until my man Tanjiro pulled out a final strike with the power of flames enveloped around him and his severed blade! That final demon beheading is reason enough alone for this getting on this list of the best anime fight scenes. - Elton Jones"
7. Kyojuro Rengoku vs. Akaza,'Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train',"Azaka is such an easily hateable character, which made it equally easy for me to cheer on Rengoku as he kept up with his enemy's powerful blows and responded with devastating sword slashes in retaliation. Azaka almost got his ass beheaded! But in the end, Rengoku went out like a G and showed his fellow ""Demon Slayers"" what it means to be a great protector. - Elton Jones"
8. The Demon Slayers vs. Daki and Gyutaro,‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba’,"Tengen and Tanjiro presented a strong united front against Gyutaro while Zenitsu and Inosuke did the same during their struggle against the domineering Daki. I damn near woke up my neighbors cause I screamed like a schoolgirl when Tengen rushed in to hack off Gyutaro's legs! The ""Entertainment District Arc"" of Demon Slayer certainly went out with a bang. - Elton Jones"
9. Jotaro vs. Dio,‘JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders’,"But I breathed the biggest sigh of relief when Jotaro popped up right behind Dio and used ""Star Platinum"" to break ""The World"" Apart with a vicious punch to the leg. I regularly return to this fight cause I love how much of a savage Dio is and appreciate Jotaro's sheer will in the face of certain doom. - Elton Jones"
10. Cioccolata vs. Giorno Giovanna,'JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind’,"Even with all that being said, my boy Giorno and precious #5 of the ""Sex Pistols"" did a damn good job of getting rid of Cioccolata once and for all. Watching Giorno explain how he outsmarted and ultimately defeated the crazed Cioccolata in the end certainly qualifies this clash as one of the best anime fight scenes ever. - Elton Jones"
11. Mob vs. Koyama (First Fight),‘Mob Psycho 100’,"Mob ain't tryna hurt nobody! But throughout Mob Pyscho 100, he's pushed to his limit by other ""Espers"" who threaten him and his friends. That fact is readily apparent the first time Mob catches Koyama in an alleyway for their very first encounter. After capturing Mob's older brother Ritsu, Mob steps up to do battle in order to rescue him. What ensues is one of the grittiest yet still flashiest psychic power-fueled fights in Mob Psycho 100. The small alleyway Mob and Koyama battle in is adequate enough to withhold all the vicious fisticuffs that break out during their encounter. When Mob reaches 100% and finally incapacitates Koyama, I gave that young hero a round of applause that lasted more than an hour! - Elton Jones"
12. Ash vs. Leon,‘Pokémon Journeys: The Series’,"The greatest moment of all in this one happened between two of my favorite OG Pokémon, Pikachu and Charizard. When it looked like all hope was lost, Pikachu landed one final lightning-charged headbutt to net Ash the biggest victory of his career. When you consider that moment and the preceding battles that took place shortly before it, you have to take notice of this encounter as one of the best anime fight scenes in the history of one of my favorite genres. - Elton Jones"
13. Eren vs. Annie,'Attack on Titan',"This is a quintessential Attack on Titan fight scene and one of the first times that the viewer really sees two human-like titans fighting rather than seeing a pure titan taken on by a human. It foreshadows so much of what we end up seeing for the new few seasons, where members of the nine titans fight against each other, demonstrating the combat IQ and technical skill they all have. The female titan is the very first titan we see that isn't a pure titan, meaning it can think intelligently and operates more like a human, so their fight is the culmination of one of the largest narrative shifts in the show up to that point. - Charlie Kolbrener"
14. Spike Spiegel vs. Vicious,‘Cowboy Bebop’,"From an aesthetic perspective, this scene is such an incredible set piece, perfectly encapsulating the noir style of so much of the show's run. Spike and Vicious even mirror each other visually, with parallel but different hairstyles and outfits. Their final battle also finally gives fuller context to the rose motif sprinkled throughout the series. - Charlie Kolbrener"
15. Chairman Netero vs. Meruem,‘Hunter x Hunter’,"SPOILERS: What makes the final arc so interesting is the evolution the human characters go through as they lose their humanity. In order to defeat Meruem, Netero eventually needs to use humanity's most unethical weapon, essentially a nuclear bomb. Simultaneously, Meruem is becoming more sympathetic and human-like, finding great joy in battle and respect for the strength of his opponent. It's a beautiful culmination of the themes of the show, rivaled only by the meeting of Gon and Neferpitou. - Charlie Kolbrener"
16. Yusuke vs. Younger Toguro,‘Yu Yu Hakusho’,"Tournament arcs are such a tried and true method of creating an epic fight because of the means through which they can build stakes. You should someone crazy strong beat someone crazy strong. And then you show someone beat them! Dang, they're strong! And amid numerous tournament arcs, the Dark Tournament is truly the blueprint. Toguro's on-the-nose ability to consistently raise his power level provides an explicit stakes-raising component throughout the fight, and we finally get to see Yusuke putting his evolving power to the test. - Charlie Kolbrener"
17. Edward Elric vs. Father,‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood’,"This one is pretty hard to sum up with brevity for this article. If you haven't watched Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, go do it. Seriously. While the fight itself is certainly visually appealing, it's more so the narrative weight this battle holds that makes it such a compelling sequence. The music, the dialogue, and the ability to tie up so much of what has occurred over the complex run of the series make this one of the most incredible fights in anime history from a purely narrative perspective. - Charlie Kolbrener"
18. Rock Lee vs. Gaara,'Naruto',"That being said, when Guy Sensei instructs Rock Lee that he can remove his ankle weights (to scoffs from the onlookers) and reveals that Lee relies entirely on Taijutsu, the fight truly begins. It is really one of the coolest demonstrations of speed, skill, and tenacity in anime. Most Naruto viewers can probably vividly remember witnessing Rock Lee land his first blow on Gaara. - Charlie Kolbrener"
19. Gon vs. Neferpitou,‘Hunter x Hunter’,"By summoning all of the power he will ever possess, Gon becomes a bloodthirsty version of himself (so immensely distinct from the boy we begin the show with) in order to defeat the series' second most powerful antagonist. In this sequence, Pitou even notes that Gon could potentially rival the king himself. The run-up to Gon's transition, when he realizes that Kite is gone for good, is one of the most heartbreaking moments in anime, and the final battle is the perfect culmination of the complex themes of the arc. - Charlie Kolbrener"
20. Luffy vs. Rob Lucci,'One Piece',"Perhaps the most exciting part of this encounter—both visually and narratively—is the debut of Luffy's ""Gear 2."" His first foray into using the gear ability foreshadows a lot of how he will develop as a devil fruit-user for the arcs to come and finally starts to solidify Luffy as powerful enough to take to the New World. - Charlie Kolbrener"
21. Luffy vs. Kaido,'One Piece',"It could definitely be recency bias, but this is certainly one of the most compelling one-on-one fights in One Piece. I personally had to decide between this and Luffy's fight with Katakuri but opted for this because the latter begins to drag a bit. The stakes in this battle are just so high; Kaido has been hinted at and teased for literally hundreds of episodes leading up to this showdown. The fight also fully demonstrates the efficacy of Snake Man, which we had only seen previously in the battle against Katakuri. Visually, battles that feature Luffy fighting someone big are always the most fun to watch. - Charlie Kolbrener"
22. Saitama vs. Genos,‘One Punch Man’,"One of the funniest fights in the show, the early battle between Saitama and Genos sets up the primary narrative of the series. Whereas Genos has both trained immensely and developed his cyborg tech tirelessly for years, his power pales in comparison to Saitama's measly workout routine. Saitama's punch blasting away the entirety of a mountain is a nice finishing touch in the sequence and a demonstration that we have yet to even begin to see his true power. - Charlie Kolbrener"
23. Saitama vs. Boros,‘One Punch Man’,"I love Saitama vs Boros because of how it establishes even more fully the direct logic of the show. When people get into power scaling conversations about Saitama (""Goku solos Saitama!""), I point them to this fight. Boros is a galaxy-destroying threat. Within his own universe, he is Goku. The very point of the show is that there is no amount of relative power one can possess within their own diegesis that will rival Saitama. He is the ""One Punch Man."" And for that, he is also the most powerful anime character of all time. - Charlie Kolbrener"
24. Asuka vs. Mass Production Eva Series,‘The End of Evangelion’,"Mecha narratives have become such a quintessential part of anime, and no series really does the genre more justice than Neon Genesis: Evangelion. What sets Evangelion apart is that it’s incredibly gory; the machines possess a human-like quality, so the violence is always much more disturbing than we witness in other mecha anime. In all honesty, I still get pretty lost in the iconic alternate ending to the mind-bending and emotionally rich mech classic. If you do too, check out this helpful guide.What I can say is, big robot fight make brain go brrr. - Charlie Kolbrener"
25. Naruto vs. Sasuke (Final Fight),'Naruto Shippuden',"Naruto tapped into his devastating ""Six Paths Sage Mode"" and Sasuke went deep inside himself to utilize the full power of his ""Rinnegan"" - the result of both friends turned enemies relying on their unleashed power led to one of the greatest Naruto fights I've ever seen. The ""Valley of the End"" was quite fitting as the final battlefield where two characters fans grew up with from the very start of the series went head-to-head for the very last time. Man, those flashbacks did something to me emotionally! - Elton Jones"
26. Universe 6 vs. Jiren,'Dragon Ball Super',"At that moment, the tears started flowing as I realized the Dragon Ball Super anime had come to a close with the image of Goku and Frieza coming together to beat back a common foe. Shout out to Android 16 for staying in the ring long enough to win the tournament for his universe and save the multiverse at large. - Elton Jones"
27. Naruto vs. Pain,'Naruto Shippuden',"What follows is a clash that brings forth vicious hand-to-hand skirmishes, ""Animal Path"" summons, Naruto's ""Sage Mode,"" and one of the biggest versions of the ""Rasenshuriken"" I've ever seen. The sheer level of destruction that erupts during this fight is another reason why I get such joy out of rewatching this epic battle. - Elton Jones"
28. Deku vs. Todoroki,'My Hero Academia',"Deku tapped into ""One for All"" to bash the massive ice cycles thrown at him, while Todoroki pushed his ""Half-Cold Half-Hot"" powers to the extreme to throw Deku off his game. The stalemate at the end had my jaw on the floor - even though Cementoss threw up some barriers to negate the clash of Deku and Todoroki's biggest attacks, the stadium still took a huge brunt of the force they both delivered. What a hell of a way to have this one end in a tie! - Elton Jones"
